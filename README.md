# Globus Web Project - Image Repository

This repository is used to host image assets for my website project: [Globus Web Project](https://github.com/Yogesh-jaiswal/globus-web-project/).

All images linked in the website's HTML and CSS files are served from this repository using raw GitHub URLs.

## Purpose

Since GitHub Pages only allows static hosting and does not support uploading separate image files without bloating the main code repository, I decided to store the images here.

This helps keep the main project clean and focused on HTML, CSS, and JS files.

## Note

This repository is **not** meant for general image hosting or third-party use. All images belong to the Globus Web Project or are used under fair use licenses.

Feel free to visit the main website repo:
